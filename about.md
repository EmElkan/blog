I'm a Test Engineer from [Hull](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingston_upon_Hull), England. After graduating from The Hull School of Art and Design with a degree in Creative Arts, I spent several years raising a family. In April 2019 I started my first job in software development as a Trainee Software Tester.


>“It’s better to practice risky things often and in small chunks, than to avoid risky things altogether.”<cite>Charity Majors</cite>

I enjoy learning and creating. I'm interested in cloud technologies, automation, exploratory functional and non-functional testing. 

Thanks for stopping by!
