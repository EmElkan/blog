Recently I've been learning all about API testing with Postman. I've put together a small collection of my favourite tutorials and practice API's for anyone else who is new to API testing and wants to learn more.

### What is Postman?
[Postman](https://www.getpostman.com/) is currently one of the most popular tools used in API testing. It's free for individuals and small teams with wide support for all API types. It can be used for [exploratory testing](https://www.getpostman.com/use-cases/exploratory-testing) and [automated testing](https://www.getpostman.com/automated-testing).

### Tutorials
[The Postman Learning Center](https://learning.getpostman.com/?_ga=2.97498591.151621366.1577222241-1815186062.1576190324)

### Code Snippets
Check Status code is 200:
```
pm.test("Status code is 200", function () {
    pm.response.to.have.status(200);
});
```
Check response time is below 300ms:
```
pm.test("Response time is less than 300ms", function () {
    pm.expect(pm.response.responseTime).to.be.below(300);
});
```
Check a value is true:
```
pm.test("Check Connected is true", function () {
    var jsonData = pm.response.json();
    pm.expect(jsonData.Connected).to.eql(true);
});
```
Check values within an array:
```
pm.test("First group in list is Test 1", function () {
    var json = pm.response.json();
    pm.expect(json[0].Name).to.eql("Test 1");
    pm.expect(json[0].State).to.eql(3);
    1pm.expect(json[0].Type).to.eql(1);
});
```
